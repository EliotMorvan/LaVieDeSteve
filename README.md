# LaVieDeSteve
Steve wants to aim a lot of money by seeling out pickaxes. Those artifacts can be crafted on the "Atelier" (workshop), sold at the "magasin" (store).<br/> To craft them, Steve can find the necesary components into the forest and the mine.
Steve'AI is coded in Java language following rules:<br/>
- He first wants to sell his artefacts.<br/>
- If he can't sell them but craft, he will go to his workshop.<br/>
- A pickaxe requires 3 pieces of stone or iron and 1 piece of wood.<br/>
- Steve can handle 14 pieces of materials each day.<br/>
- Steve has 1/3 chances to look for iron and 1/2 chance to find a piece of iron.<br/>

The pdf will show the path to help Steve on two of the main questions:
What will be his average gain on a period n and what would be the best improvment.
